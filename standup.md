# Standup

Check your calendar for the invitation to the team standup. It's usually held once a week.

We take turns answering the below questions and then move on to _other_.

If the whole thing takes more than 10 minutes, we're doing it wrong.

## Questions

- Do you have enough to do?
- Do you need help with anything?
  - If yes, what? (resolution happens outside, and after, the standup)
