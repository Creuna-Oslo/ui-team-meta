# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to this repository.

Please be respectful when commenting or contributing.

## Branching

We treat this repository much like a code repository.

If you create branches in this repository, use prefixes for the type of content the branch contains: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`.

Feature `A` would therefore have the branch `feature/a`.

## Pull Requests

Create pull requests with changes you want to merge.

Describe why you want these changes so that it's easier for reviewers to review them.

_Anyone can review anything_.

Pull requests are a good way of starting a discussion about wanted changes. We welcome these discussions and prefer to have them out in the open as part of the pull request.

## Merging

All team members can merge pull requests, but please remember that when you do so you are agreeing to the changes being merged.

If you don't want to merge a pull request, but would like to indicate that you approve of the content, submit a review using the `Review changes` tool (found under `Files changed` on the pull request).

## Language

Use US English unless otherwise noted and/or required.

Remember to ensure that your content has correct spelling and grammar.
