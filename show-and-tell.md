# Show and Tell Guidelines

_Show and Tell_ is held every week. Check your calendar for the invitation.

There is a new presenter each week, cycling alphabetically through the whole team.

## 👩‍🏫 Presenter

- Move the arrow to the next person on the list (the list is pinned in our Slack channel)
- Show your last (or current) task/user story, or something else
- Max 30 minutes
- Nothing is too small
- Nothing is too big
- Nothing is too “un-cool”, boring or trivial
- Zero-preparation policy: just demo your thing and show the code
- What problems did you encounter, if any?
- Did it take you as long as you thought it would?

## 🙋‍ Reviewers

- Be polite and kind
- Be interested, without being annoying.
  - “That’s interesting, I would have done it in this way. Would that maybe work? Which is better, and why?”
  - ”Is there a reason for that?”
- Remember to compliment the good things. i.e. “Wow, I've never thought of that - very clever”
- Give your feedback the way you would like to receive it
- Let the reviewee do most of the talking
- Be specific when giving feedback
