# List of good to have Software #

This is a list of software that was suggested to new employees in August 2018. All that was suggested is in the list, but what you actually need will depend on the project you will work on.

## OS-agnostic software ##
* Visual Studio Code

This is an editor a lot of people use

* [Source tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

  This is Atlassians gui offering for a git [porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)

* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

  Is a much more convenient alternative to normal backwards-search in the console found at `C-r` (Control - r)

* [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd)

  tired of typing `cd ./really/long/path/with/different/capitalizations/just/to/navigate/to/projectname`?
  with fasd you can just type `j projectname` and it will probably get you where you are going

## Not windows
* [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html)

  Nix does a lot of really useful things. It's not only a package manager or an Os or a Deployment tool.
  It allows you to define local environments for your projects where for example node and npm are at some
  specific version, (you won't even need to have node installed on your system!)

## OSX ##
* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) 
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* [Windows in Boot Camp](https://www.imore.com/how-install-windows-your-mac-boot-camp)

## Windows ##
* Visual Studio

* [https://chocolatey.org/install](Chocolatey) - A package manager for windows, like brew

## Not really software ##
* [Connection to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
