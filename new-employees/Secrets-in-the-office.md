# The Secrets of the Creuna Office #

There is a lot of little secrets hidden around in the office. 
Some of those spots have taken your co-workers years to find.
You will get alot of those reveled for you in this list. <br>
Feel free to add your own.


## Hardware and Licenses ##

Do you have a wishe for special hardware or long for a license for a nice program? All that and more can usely be granted by the IT department. Send an email to it@creuna.no or just stroll in and ask. Remeber, ask nicely. 
The IT department is located in the other end of the building from the entrence. Behind the second mezzanine.

## Comunication ##

Of course everyone have an email. Of course no one sends emails (exept for call to meetings). Most of all internal comunication is handled on [Slack](https://slack.com/). It is highly recomanded to download both on desktop and cellphone. Join the creuna-no.slack.com team by signing in with your Creuna username. Channels that might be good to join:
* #creuna_fredagspils
* #frontend
* #developers
* #creuna-github
* #random

Of course you also need to join the team-ui, but this is a locked channel som you will need an invitation from one of your co-workers, or Pappa himself. There is alot of not-so-serius stuff going on on Slack, but dont think you can turn of all notifications and ignore it. Alot of important information is also passed on Slack. If you don´t pay attention to Slack you might find out that you don´t know where that important meeting moved or that someone can help you with a problem. Also, you might miss cake time. 

You should also join [workplace](https://creuna.facebook.com/). Sign in with your Creuna username and password. Take a bit of time and find good groups to follow. Some tips are:
* NO Creuna Norway
* ALL Unit4 in Creuna
* NO KAPASITET
* NO Oslo Tech - Faggruppe
* NO Nytt og nyttig fra HR og Admin. Norway


## Very important people, and where to find them ##

* Line - She knows the where, when, who and why of the entire office. you can usually find her on her place right infront of the main entrance.
* Marius Eple (Head of the IT department) - Grant wishes for hardware, licenses and fix everything connected to electricity. usually to be found in the IT department. 
* Pelle (Pappa) - Can most offen be found on his place beneath the Jolly Roger. 
* Rolf (head of Tech) - His place are almost in the middle of the office.

## Coffee and toiletts ##

The majority of the Creuna employees agree that the coffee in the canteen is the best coffee in the office. <br>
Other sources of caffeine is the coffe machine in the entrence or the hidden coffee machine. The hidden coffee machine you can find beneath the stairs to the second mezzanine. <br>
If your want a cup of really good coffee Creuna employees have discount on all coffee at [CaféRo](https://www.cafero.no/) located by the tramstop. Remeber to tell them "Bedriftskafe Creuna" - **before** ordering. <br>
There is alot of toliletts in the office, take your time to find your favorite. The most hidden pearl among those is the one close to the door to Total Reform. Most toiletts are unisex, with the exceptions of the on in the wardrobes
(most likely becouse those also containse showers).  

## Recreation ##

Need a break from that impossible bug? There is nice tings to do here in the office if you need to give your brain a break. Why not play a game on one of the arcade machines in the canteen? They are built here, in the office, by Creuna employees! <br> 
Feel like having a challenging disscusion? Try to discuss politics with Pepper, he is uselly hanging around next to Lines place in the entrance. Already bored with Pepper? Why not invite a co-worker to take a coffee on the '70s mezzanine? <br>
Want to feel the sun on your face? or maybe you belong to the nearly extinct species, the smokers? There is a little balcony on the side of the office building. Just go to the right by the award shelf and the door out is after the entrance to the architect firm. Remeber to bring your access card or you will be locked out.
