# The Secrets of the Creuna Office

There is a lot of little secrets hidden around in the office. Some of those spots have taken your co-workers years to find. You will get a lot of those reveal for you in this list.
Feel free to add your own.

## Hardware and Licenses

Do you have a wish for special hardware or long for a license for a nice program? All that and more can be granted by the IT department. Send an email to it@creuna.no or just stroll in and ask. Remember, ask nicely. The IT department is located in the other end of the building from the entrance. Behind the second mezzanine.

## Communication

Of course everyone have an email. Of course no one sends emails (except for call to meetings). Most of all internal communication is handled on Slack. It is highly recommended to download both on desktop and cellphone. Join the creuna-no.slack.com team by signing in with your Creuna username. Channels that might be good to join:

- #creuna_fredagspils
- #frontend
- #developers
- #creuna-github
- #random

Of course you also need to join the #team-ui, but this is a locked channel so you will need an invitation from one of your fellow team members, or Pappa himself. There is a lot of not-so-serous stuff going on on Slack, but don't think you can turn of all notifications and ignore it. A lot of important information is also passed on Slack. If you don't pay attention to Slack you might find out that you don't know where that important meeting moved or that someone can help you with a problem. Also, you might miss cake time.

You should also join workplace. Sign in with your Creuna username and password. Take a bit of time and find good groups to follow. Some tips are:

- NO Creuna Norway
- ALL Unit4 in Creuna
- NO KAPASITET
- NO Oslo Tech - Faggruppe
- NO Nytt og nyttig fra HR og Admin. Norway

## Time registration

All employees in Creuna will have to endure registration of their work hours in Unit4. The experience can be made better with this Chrome plugin. There is some good instruction videos in the workplace Unit4 Group. The information for registering your hours for different projects is usually given by the project leader.
